Provide notification emails and controls for bbPress subscriptions, merge, and split functions.

== Description ==

bbPress Email Notifications provides users with various email notifications relating to forum changes, as well
as the ability to turn these notifications off. It overrides the bbPress-provided 'Subscribe' function, 
allowing users to turn all subscribed topic notifications off and on in one location. 

BuddyPress users can update their bbPress email preferences at Member > Settings > Notifications. WordPress
users can update their preferences at Users > Your Profile.

This plugin deals solely with bbPress plugin forums, and not with BuddyPress group forums. 

Filters are available for modification of plugin behavior. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `bbpress-email-notifications` folder and its contents to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
